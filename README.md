scloud
======
scloud is a symfony2 project mainly focused on storing images on a server.
It also supports other type of files just like dropbox but it has more features for images like batch processing with injected handlers.
The main features of this project is the advanced sharing and groups for files and directories
I give away 50GB of space for free to anyone helping me out with the frontend of this project ;)

Why?
-------

You might ask why I started this project!

Here is the list

* I love symfony
* I did not find the open source project I was searching for
* I wanted to write an open source project(never had time)
* I love programming!

I guess that is enough right?
